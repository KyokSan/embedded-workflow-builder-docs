Manage records, contacts, and transactions in Zoho CRM and Books

## Connections

### OAuth 2.0 {#zohotemplatedconnection}

OAuth 2.0 Connection

To connect to Zoho CRM or Zoho Books, create a Client application in the [Zoho Developer Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/).

Zoho supports OAuth 2.0 authentication for both [Zoho CRM](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/oauth-overview.html) and [Zoho Books](https://www.zoho.com/books/api/v3/oauth/#overview) APIs. The same OAuth client can be configured to access multiple Zoho services by combining their scopes.

#### Prerequisites

- Access to the [Zoho Developer Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/)
- A Zoho account with appropriate permissions to create OAuth clients
- Knowledge of which Zoho region the account is hosted in (see [Zoho region information](https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/serverinfo))

#### Setup Steps

1. Log in to the [Zoho Developer Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/)
2. Click **ADD CLIENT**
3. Select **Server-based Applications** as the client type
4. Configure the client application:
   - Enter a descriptive name in the **Client Name** field
   - Enter the application homepage URL in the **Homepage URL** field
   - Under **Authorized Redirect URIs**, add: `https://oauth2.%WHITE_LABEL_BASE_URL%/callback`
5. Click **CREATE** to generate the client
6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values displayed on the confirmation page

For detailed information about creating OAuth clients, refer to the [Zoho OAuth client registration documentation](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/register-client.html).

#### Configure the Connection

- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Zoho Developer Console
- Select the appropriate **Region URL** for the Zoho account's data center location:
  - **United States**: `https://accounts.zoho.com`
  - **Europe**: `https://accounts.zoho.eu`
  - **India**: `https://accounts.zoho.in`
  - **Australia**: `https://accounts.zoho.com.au`
  - **Japan**: `https://accounts.zoho.jp`
  - **United Kingdom**: `https://accounts.zoho.uk`
  - **Canada**: `https://accounts.zohocloud.ca`
  - **United Arab Emirates**: `https://accounts.zoho.ae`
  - **Saudi Arabia**: `https://accounts.zoho.sa`

  Refer to [Zoho's server information page](https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/serverinfo) to determine the correct region URL.

- Configure the **Scopes** field with the required permissions:
  - For Zoho CRM access, refer to the [Zoho CRM scopes documentation](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/scopes.html)
  - For Zoho Books access, refer to the [Zoho Books scopes documentation](https://www.zoho.com/books/api/v3/oauth/#overview)
  - Multiple scopes can be combined by separating them with spaces
  - Example for both CRM and Books access:
    ```
    ZohoCRM.modules.ALL ZohoCRM.settings.ALL ZohoBooks.fullaccess.all
    ```

:::note Multi Region Deployments
For integrations that will be deployed to users in multiple Zoho regions, configure the **Region URL** field to be visible to instance deployers. This allows end users to select their appropriate region during instance configuration.

To make the Region URL field visible to deployers, enable the field visibility in the connection configuration:

./assets

This connection uses OAuth 2.0, a common authentication mechanism for integrations.
Read about how OAuth 2.0 works [here](../oauth2.md).
