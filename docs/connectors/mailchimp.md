### Mailchimp API Key {#apikey}

Authenticate requests to Mailchimp using an API Key

To authenticate with Mailchimp using an API Key, generate a key from the Mailchimp account settings.

For detailed information about API key authentication, refer to [Mailchimp's API quickstart guide](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/quick-start/).

#### Prerequisites

- A [Mailchimp account](https://mailchimp.com/) with admin access
- Access to the [API Keys](https://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/) settings page

#### Setup Steps

To generate an API key:

1. Navigate to the [API Keys](https://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/) page in the Mailchimp account settings.
2. Scroll to the **Your API keys** section.
3. Click **Create A Key** to generate a new API key.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the key (e.g., "Integration API Key").
5. Copy the generated API key value.

:::warning API Key Format
Mailchimp API keys include a data center suffix (e.g., `abc123def456-us21`). The suffix after the hyphen indicates the data center where the account is hosted. This suffix is required for the API to route requests correctly.
:::

#### Configure the Connection

- Enter the full **API Key** (including the data center suffix) into the connection configuration.
