## Connections

### OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code {#templatedoauth}

Authenticates actions in all Microsoft's Graph API services.

To connect to Microsoft Outlook using OAuth 2.0, create an App Registration in Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure Active Directory).

#### Prerequisites

- Access to a [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) or [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)
- Permissions to create App Registrations

#### Setup Steps

1. Navigate to [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and create a new **App Registration**
2. When creating the application, select **Supported account types**:
   - Choose **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)** to allow users from other organizations to authenticate
3. Under **Platforms**, add the **Web** platform:
   - Add `https://oauth2.%WHITE_LABEL_BASE_URL%/callback` as a **Redirect URI**
4. Navigate to **Certificates & Secrets** and create a new **Client Secret**:
   - Copy the **Value** of the client secret (this will only be shown once)
5. Navigate to the **Overview** page and copy the **Application (client) ID**

#### Configure the Connection

- Enter the **Application (client) ID** value into the **Client ID** field
- Enter the **Client Secret** value into the same named field
- The default scopes are pre-configured for common use cases:

  ```
  https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.ReadWrite https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.ReadWrite https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Send offline_access
  ```

  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read` - Read basic user data
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.ReadWrite` - Manage Outlook calendar
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.ReadWrite` - Manage email
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Send` - Send email
  - `offline_access` - Maintain OAuth connection and receive refresh tokens
  - Refer to [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference) for additional scope information

- **Additional Authorization Parameters** (optional) - Query string parameters appended to the OAuth authorization URL:
  - Use `prompt=consent` to force Microsoft to display the consent screen, which is useful when you've changed the requested scopes and need users to re-authorize
  - Use `login_hint=user@example.com` to pre-fill the user's email address on the sign-in page
  - Multiple parameters can be combined with `&` (e.g., `prompt=consent&login_hint=user@example.com`)

:::note Single-Tenant Applications
For single-tenant applications (not Multitenant), tenant-specific URLs are required. The connection will automatically handle tenant-specific configuration when a Tenant ID is provided.
:::

:::info Cloud Environments
The connection supports different Microsoft cloud environments (Commercial, Government, China). The Base URL will automatically adjust based on the selected cloud environment.
:::

This connection uses OAuth 2.0, a common authentication mechanism for integrations.
Read about how OAuth 2.0 works [here](../oauth2.md).

### OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code (Deprecated) {#oauth}

OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Connectivity for Microsoft Outlook

You will first need to create and configure a new "App Registration" within your [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
When creating the application you will be prompted to select the 'Supported account types'. Under this section, be sure to select 'Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)'.

You will need to go to "Platforms" and add the "Web" platform. In that section you should add the OAuth 2.0 callback URL - `https://oauth2.%WHITE_LABEL_BASE_URL%/callback` - as a **Redirect URI**.

Next, go to "Certificates & Secrets" for the app and add a new **Client Secret**. Note this value as you will need to supply it to the connection.

You will also need the **Application (client) ID** from the "Overview" page.

Now, configure the OAuth 2.0 connection.
Add an Microsoft Outlook OAuth 2.0 connection config variable:

- Use the **Application (client) ID** value for the **Client ID** field.
- Use the **Client Secret** for the same named field.
- If you didn't select Multitenant when creating the Azure application, you will need to replace the **Authorize URL** and **Token URL** with ones specific to your tenant.
- The default scopes are as follows. You can remove scopes that you don't need:
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read` for reading basic user data
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.ReadWrite` for managing Outlook calendar
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.ReadWrite` for managing email
  - `https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Send` for sending email
  - Ensure the `offline_access` scope is included in your app registration. It is essential to maintain your OAuth connection and receive refresh tokens. Without it, users will need to re-authenticate every hour.

Save your integration and you should be able to authenticate a user with OAuth 2.0 to access their Microsoft Outlook data.

This connection uses OAuth 2.0, a common authentication mechanism for integrations.
Read about how OAuth 2.0 works [here](../oauth2.md).

### OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials {#oauthclientcredentials}

Authenticates actions in all Microsoft's Graph API services.

To connect to Microsoft Outlook using OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow, create an App Registration with application permissions in Microsoft Entra.

The Client Credentials flow is used for server-to-server authentication without user interaction, requiring application-level permissions and admin consent.

#### Prerequisites

- Access to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/)
- Permissions to create App Registrations and grant admin consent
- Tenant ID for the organization

#### Setup Steps

1. Navigate to [Microsoft Entra](https://entra.microsoft.com/) **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** and select **New registration**:
   - Set **Supported Account types** to **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)** to allow access from other organizations
   - Set the **Redirect URI** dropdown to **Web** platform and add `https://oauth2.%WHITE_LABEL_BASE_URL%/callback` as a **Redirect URI**
   - Select **Register** to complete
2. From the App menu, navigate to **Certificates & Secrets** and add a new **Client Secret**:
   - Copy the **Value** for the **Client Secret** (this will only be shown once)
3. Navigate to the **Overview** page and copy the **Application (client) ID**
4. Navigate to **API Permissions** and configure application permissions:
   - Select **Add Permission** > **Microsoft Graph** > **Application permissions**
   - Add all permissions required for the use case (e.g., `Mail.ReadWrite`, `Calendars.ReadWrite`, `User.Read.All`)
   - Refer to [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference) for available permissions
5. After applying all relevant permissions, select **Grant Admin Consent** to authorize the application permissions

#### Configure the Connection

- Enter the **Tenant ID** for the organization being accessed
- Enter the **Application (client) ID** value into the **Client ID** field
- Enter the **Client Secret** value into the same named field
- Enter the **User ID** of the user whose data will be accessed (required for user-specific endpoints)
- The default scope `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` is pre-configured for the connection

:::note Client Credentials vs Authorization Code
The Client Credentials flow uses application permissions and does not require user login. This is ideal for background services and automated processes. For user-delegated permissions, use the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code** connection instead.
:::

:::warning User ID Required
All actions using the client credentials flow require a **User ID** to specify which user's data to access. This is required because application permissions operate on behalf of the application, not a signed-in user.
:::

This connection uses OAuth 2.0, a common authentication mechanism for integrations.
Read about how OAuth 2.0 works [here](../oauth2.md).
