## Connections

### OAuth 2.0 {#oauth2}

Authenticate requests to Hubspot using OAuth 2.0.

### Creating an App via the CLI

To connect to HubSpot using OAuth 2.0, create an app in the HubSpot developer platform. HubSpot offers two approaches: the latest app creation via CLI (recommended), or creating a legacy app through the web interface.

Refer to the [HubSpot app creation guide](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/developer-platform/build-apps/create-an-app) and [quick reference guide](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart) for detailed information.

#### Prerequisites

- A [HubSpot developer account](https://developers.hubspot.com/)
- Node.js and npm installed (for CLI-based app creation)
- HubSpot CLI version 7.6.0 or higher (for CLI-based app creation)

#### Setup Steps

1. Install the HubSpot CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @hubspot/cli
   ```

2. Authenticate the CLI with the HubSpot developer account:

   ```bash
   hs account auth
   ```

3. Create a new app project:

   ```bash
   hs project create
   ```

   - Select **App** as the project template
   - Choose the distribution type (marketplace or private/specific accounts)
   - Select **OAuth** as the authentication method
   - Optionally select app features (Card, App Function, Settings, Webhooks, Custom Workflow Action)

4. Configure the app by editing the generated `app-hsmeta.json` file:
   - Update app name, description, and required scopes
   - Add redirect URLs for OAuth authentication

5. Upload the app project to HubSpot:

   ```bash
   hs project upload
   ```

   :::note Directory Error
   If the error `[ERROR] Unable to locate a project configuration file` appears, change to the project folder where the app was created and run the command again.
   :::

6. Open the project in the HubSpot developer portal:

   ```bash
   hs project open
   ```

7. Navigate to the **Auth** tab in the developer portal
8. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Auth page

#### Configure the Connection

- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the app's Auth page
- For **Scopes**, choose from the available scopes based on integration needs
  - Refer to [HubSpot OAuth documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/working-with-oauth) for scope details
- Under **Redirect URLs**, ensure `https://oauth2.%WHITE_LABEL_BASE_URL%/callback` has been added to the app configuration

#### Recommended Scopes

The following scopes provide comprehensive access to HubSpot CRM functionality that this component supports:

**Essential Scopes:**

- `oauth` - Required for all OAuth apps (cannot be removed)
- `crm.objects.owners.read` - Read owner information

**CRM Objects:**

- `crm.objects.contacts.read` `crm.objects.contacts.write` - Contacts management
- `crm.objects.companies.read` `crm.objects.companies.write` - Companies management
- `crm.objects.deals.read` `crm.objects.deals.write` - Deals management
- `crm.objects.custom.read` `crm.objects.custom.write` - Custom objects management

**Additional CRM Objects:**

- `crm.objects.line_items.read` `crm.objects.line_items.write` - Line items management
- `crm.objects.quotes.read` `crm.objects.quotes.write` - Quotes management
- `tickets` - Ticket management (legacy scope covers read/write)

**Engagement Types:**

- `crm.schemas.contacts.read` - Contact property definitions
- `crm.schemas.companies.read` - Company property definitions
- `crm.schemas.deals.read` - Deal property definitions

**Webhooks:**

- `webhooks` - Create and manage webhook subscriptions (requires App ID and Developer API Key)

**Example minimal scope configuration:**

```
crm.objects.contacts.read crm.objects.contacts.write crm.objects.deals.read crm.objects.deals.write crm.objects.owners.read
```

For a complete list of available scopes, refer to the [HubSpot OAuth scopes documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/oauth/scopes).

### Creating a Legacy App

:::warning Legacy Apps
Legacy apps will continue to work, but they won't receive new features or platform improvements from HubSpot. The CLI-based approach is recommended for new integrations.
:::

#### Setup Steps

1. Navigate to the [HubSpot developer account portal](https://app.hubspot.com/developer)
2. Click **Create app** to create a new public app
3. Fill in the app details (name, description, etc.)
4. Navigate to the **Auth** tab of the newly created app
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from this page
6. Under **Redirect URLs**, add `https://oauth2.%WHITE_LABEL_BASE_URL%/callback`
7. Configure the required scopes for the integration in the **Scopes** section

This connection uses OAuth 2.0, a common authentication mechanism for integrations.
Read about how OAuth 2.0 works [here](../oauth2.md).

| Scopes            | OAuth permission scopes. See [HubSpot scopes](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/oauth/scopes) for available scopes. |                                         |
| Client ID         | The Client ID from your HubSpot app. Find this in HubSpot Developer Account > Apps > Auth.                                |                                         |

### Private App Access Token {#privateappaccesstoken}

Authenticate requests to Hubspot using a private app access token.

Private app access tokens are recommended for testing purposes only. For production integrations, OAuth 2.0 should be used to allow users to authenticate with their own credentials.

Private app access tokens do not expire but can be revoked at any time from the HubSpot account settings.

#### Prerequisites

- Access to a [HubSpot account](https://app.hubspot.com)
- Appropriate permissions to create private apps

#### Setup Steps

To generate a private app access token:

1. Navigate to [HubSpot](https://app.hubspot.com) and log in
2. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Private Apps**
3. Click **Create a private app**
4. Enter a name for the app
5. Configure the required scopes for the integration
6. After creating the app, navigate to the **Auth** tab
7. Copy the **Access Token** displayed

#### Configure the Connection

- Enter the **Access Token** from the HubSpot private app settings into the connection configuration

| Input        | Comments                                                                                                                        | Default |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Access Token | An access token generated when you create a private app. For testing purposes only - use OAuth 2.0 for production integrations. |         |

### Webhook Authentication {#hubspotoauthtrigger}

Authenticate HubSpot webhooks using Client Secret for signature verification only.

The Webhook Authentication connection is used specifically for verifying HubSpot webhook signatures to ensure webhook requests are legitimate.

This connection is only used for webhook triggers and does not grant API access. It solely validates that incoming webhooks are from HubSpot by verifying the request signature.

#### Prerequisites

- Access to a [HubSpot account](https://app.hubspot.com)
- Appropriate permissions to create private apps or manage existing apps
- A configured HubSpot app with webhook capabilities

#### Setup Steps

1. Navigate to [HubSpot](https://app.hubspot.com) and log in
2. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Private Apps**
3. To create a new app:
   - Click **Create a private app** or **Create an app**
   - Configure the required webhook subscriptions
4. Navigate to the **Auth** or **App Credentials** section
5. Copy the **Client Secret** value

#### Configure the Connection

- Enter the **Client Secret** from the HubSpot app into the connection configuration
- The client secret is used to verify webhook signatures
- Ensure the trigger is configured to use the Webhook Authentication connection

#### Webhook Subscriptions

After configuring the connection, webhook subscriptions must be set up:

1. In the app settings, navigate to the **Webhooks** section
2. Click **Configure** or **Set up webhooks**
3. Provide the following:
   - **Target URL**: The webhook endpoint URL where HubSpot will send webhook events (found in **Test Configuration > Trigger Payload** section of the integration)
   - **Events to subscribe to**: Select the specific events to monitor (e.g., contact created, deal updated, company deleted)

| Input         | Comments                                                                    | Default |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Client Secret | The Client Secret from your HubSpot app, used to verify webhook signatures. |         |
