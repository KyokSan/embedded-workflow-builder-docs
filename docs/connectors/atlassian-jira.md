## Connections

### Basic Authentication {#basic}

Authenticate with Jira using username and API key

To authenticate with Atlassian Jira using Basic Authentication, an email address and either an API token (for Jira Cloud) or password (for self-hosted Jira) is required.

#### Prerequisites

- Access to a Jira Cloud or self-hosted Jira instance
- Administrative permissions to generate API tokens (for Jira Cloud)

#### Setup Steps

**For Jira Cloud:**

1. Navigate to [Atlassian Account API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Enter a label for the token and click **Create**
4. Copy the generated API token value

**For Self-Hosted Jira:**

Use the standard account password for authentication. No additional setup is required.

#### Configure the Connection

- For **Username**, enter the email address associated with the Jira account
- For **API Key**:
  - **Jira Cloud**: Enter the API token generated in the previous step
  - **Self-Hosted Jira**: Enter the account password
- For **Host**, enter the Jira instance URL (e.g., `example.atlassian.net` for cloud or the self-hosted domain)
- For **Version**, select the API version (typically `3` for Jira Cloud, `2` for older instances)

For more information on generating API tokens from Jira Cloud, refer to the [Atlassian documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).

:::note Self-Hosted vs Cloud Authentication
Jira Cloud requires an API token for Basic Authentication, while self-hosted instances can use the account password. For security reasons, it is recommended to use API tokens whenever possible.

| Username | Your Jira username or email address used for authentication.                                                                                                                   |         |
| API Key  | Your Jira API token for authentication. Cloud users must generate an API token from [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens). |         |
| Host     | The hostname of your Jira instance (without https://).                                                                                                                         |         |
| Version  | Select the Jira API version to use for requests.                                                                                                                               | 3       |

### OAuth 2.0 {#oauth2}

Authenticate with Jira using OAuth 2.0 for secure access

To create an Atlassian Jira OAuth 2.0 connection, an OAuth 2.0 integration must be configured in the [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console).

Jira's Cloud API supports OAuth 2.0 (3LO) flows for secure authentication. For more information on OAuth 2.0 (3LO) apps, refer to [Jira's OAuth 2.0 documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#enabling-oauth-2-0--3lo-).

#### Prerequisites

- Access to the [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console)
- Administrative permissions to create OAuth 2.0 integrations

#### Setup Steps

1. Navigate to the [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console)
2. Click **Create** and select **OAuth 2.0 integration**
3. Enter a name for the integration
4. After creation, locate the **App details** section and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values
5. Under the **Authorization** section, click **Configure** next to **OAuth 2.0 (3LO)**
6. Enter the callback URL: `https://oauth2.%WHITE_LABEL_BASE_URL%/callback`
7. Navigate to the **Permissions** tab
8. Add the required scopes based on the use case:
   - For basic issue management, the following scopes are recommended:
     ```
     read:jira-user read:jira-work write:jira-work manage:jira-project manage:jira-configuration manage:jira-webhook offline_access
     ```
   - Refer to [Jira OAuth 2.0 scopes documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/) for a complete list of available scopes
9. Click **Save** to apply the configuration

:::warning Scope Consistency
The scopes configured in the Atlassian Developer Console must match the scopes entered in the connection configuration. Inconsistent scopes will cause authentication failures.
:::

#### Configure the Connection

- Enter the **Client ID** from the Atlassian Developer Console
- Enter the **Client Secret** from the Atlassian Developer Console
- For **Scopes**, use the following default value:

  ```
  read:jira-user read:jira-work write:jira-work manage:jira-project manage:jira-configuration manage:jira-webhook offline_access
  ```

  - The `offline_access` scope is required to obtain a refresh token
  - Customize the scopes to match the use case requirements
  - Ensure the scopes match those configured in the Atlassian Developer Console
  - Refer to [Jira scopes documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/) for additional scope information

- For **Jira Site Name** (optional):
  - By default, the connection uses the first Jira site the authenticated user has access to
  - To specify a different site, enter the site name (e.g., `example`) or full URL (e.g., `example.atlassian.net`)
- For **Version**, select the API version (typically `3` for Jira Cloud)

For additional information on developing Jira applications and OAuth 2.0 configuration, refer to the [Jira OAuth 2.0 apps guide](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/).

This connection uses OAuth 2.0, a common authentication mechanism for integrations.
Read about how OAuth 2.0 works [here](../oauth2.md).
