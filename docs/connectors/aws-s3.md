## Connections

### AWS Role ARN {#awsassumerole}

Connect to AWS using an assumed role

AWS Assume Role authentication allows assuming an IAM role using temporary security credentials.
This method is useful for cross account access or when implementing principle of least privilege.

Refer to the [AWS documentation on assuming roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html) for detailed information.

#### Prerequisites

- Completed [API Key Secret](#apikeysecret) connection setup (access key pair required)
- Appropriate permissions to create IAM roles

#### Setup Steps

An IAM user with access keys is required to assume a role. If access keys have not been created, follow the [API Key Secret](#apikeysecret) setup steps first, then return here to create the IAM role.

##### Create an IAM Role with Trust Policy

1. From the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), navigate to **Roles** and select **Create Role**
2. Select **Custom trust policy** as the trusted entity type
3. Enter the trust policy below, replacing `USER_ARN` with the IAM user ARN:

<details>
<summary>View trust policy template</summary>

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "USER_ARN"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

4. Click **Next** and attach the appropriate S3 permissions policy (e.g., **AmazonS3FullAccess** or **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess**)
5. Complete the remaining steps and select **Create Role**
6. Copy the **Role ARN** from the role summary (format: `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/role-name`)

#### Configure the Connection

- **Role ARN**: The ARN of the IAM role to assume
- **Access Key ID**: From the IAM user (see [API Key Secret](#apikeysecret))
- **Secret Access Key**: From the IAM user
- **External ID** (optional): Shared secret for enhanced security

:::note External ID
The **External ID** provides additional security for cross-account access. Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html#id_roles_third-party_external-id) for more information.
:::

#### Verify Connection

The IAM user credentials assume the role, which provides temporary credentials with the role's attached permissions. Ensure the trust policy correctly references the IAM user ARN.

### AWS S3 Access Key and Secret {#apikeysecret}

Authenticates requests to AWS S3 using an API Key and Secret.

An AWS IAM [access key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) is required to interact with Amazon S3.
Ensure the key pair generated in AWS has proper permissions to the S3 resources to access.
Read more about S3 IAM actions in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html).

#### Prerequisites

- An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) with IAM access
- Appropriate permissions to create IAM access keys

#### Setup Steps

To create an IAM access key pair:

1. Sign in to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) and navigate to **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
2. Select the IAM user that will be used for the integration
3. Navigate to the **Security credentials** tab
4. Under the **Access keys** section, select **Create access key**
5. Choose the appropriate use case (e.g., **Third-party service** or **Application running outside AWS**)
6. Copy both the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** when displayed

:::warning Secret Key Visibility
The **Secret access key** is only shown once during creation. If it is not copied at this time, a new access key pair must be created.
:::

#### Configure the Connection

- Enter the **Access key ID** into the connection configuration
- Enter the **Secret access key** into the connection configuration
