## Connections

### OAuth2 {#oauth2}

OAuth2 Connection

To connect to Google Shopping (Content API for Shopping), create an OAuth 2.0 application in the Google Cloud Console and configure the required scopes.

For more information about Google's OAuth 2.0 implementation, refer to the [Google Identity Platform documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2).

#### Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud account with access to the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- A Google Cloud project (create one if needed)
- Billing enabled on the project (required for some API features)

#### Setup Steps

1. Navigate to the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select or create a project.
2. Enable the Content API for Shopping:
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Library**
   - Search for "Content API for Shopping"
   - Select the API and click **Enable**
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen:
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**
   - Select the appropriate user type (**Internal** for organization-only access or **External** for public access)
   - Fill in the required fields:
     - **App name**: Enter the application or company name
     - **User support email**: Provide a support contact email
     - **Developer contact information**: Add contact details
   - Click **Save and Continue**
4. Add OAuth scopes:
   - Click **Add or Remove Scopes**
   - Search for "Content API for Shopping"
   - Select the following scope:
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/content` - View and manage data for Google Shopping
   - Click **Update** and then **Save and Continue**
5. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
   - Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**
   - Under **Application type**, select **Web application**
   - Enter a name for the OAuth client
   - Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, click **Add URI** and enter: `https://oauth2.%WHITE_LABEL_BASE_URL%/callback`
   - Click **Create**
6. Copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - these values will be used to configure the connection.

To retrieve the Client ID and Secret later, navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** and select the OAuth 2.0 client from the **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** section.

#### Configure the Connection

- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the OAuth 2.0 client
- For **Scopes**, use the following value:

  ```
  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/content
  ```

  - Refer to the [Google Content API OAuth scopes documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#content) for additional scope information

:::note Publishing the OAuth Consent Screen
For production use with external users, the OAuth consent screen must be verified and published by Google. During development and testing, the app can remain in "Testing" mode with a limited number of test users. Refer to [Google's OAuth consent screen documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615) for publishing requirements.
:::

:::info Testing with Limited Users
While the app is in "Testing" mode, only users added to the test users list can authenticate. Add test users in the **OAuth consent screen** configuration under **Test users**.
:::

This connection uses OAuth 2.0, a common authentication mechanism for integrations.
Read about how OAuth 2.0 works [here](../oauth2.md).
