## Connections

### API Key {#apitoken}

API Key for a Mixpanel Account

To authenticate with Mixpanel, a service account is required for API access, along with a project token for project-specific operations.

For more information, refer to [Mixpanel's Service Account documentation](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/orgs-and-projects/service-accounts).

#### Prerequisites

- A Mixpanel account with access to organization settings
- Permissions to create service accounts in the organization
- Access to the project where the integration will be used

#### Setup Steps

**Setting up a Service Account:**

1. Navigate to [Organization Settings > Service Accounts](https://mixpanel.com/settings/org#serviceaccounts) in Mixpanel
2. Click **Add Service Account** to create a new service account
3. Select the appropriate role and grant access to the required projects
4. Click **Add** to complete the creation
5. Copy the **Username** and **Secret** values that are provided

**Obtaining the Project Token:**

1. Navigate to the [Project Settings](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project/) page in Mixpanel
2. Locate the **Access Keys** section
3. Copy the **Project Token** value

#### Configure the Connection

Enter the following values into the connection configuration:

- **Username**: The service account username from step 5 above
- **Password**: The service account secret from step 5 above
- **Project Token**: The project token from the Access Keys section

:::note Service Account Roles
The service account role determines what operations can be performed through the API. Ensure the selected role has sufficient permissions for the integration's intended use. Refer to [Mixpanel's documentation on roles and permissions](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions) for more information.
