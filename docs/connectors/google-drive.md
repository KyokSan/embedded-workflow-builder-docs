## Connections

### OAuth2 {#oauth2}

OAuth2 Connection

The Google Drive component authenticates requests through the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) OAuth 2.0 service.
A GCP OAuth 2.0 app is required for the integration to authenticate and perform Google Drive tasks on behalf of users.

#### Prerequisites

- A Google Developer account (sign up at [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/))

#### Setup Steps

To create a Google Drive OAuth 2.0 app:

1. Open the Google Drive API console at [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com)
1. Click **CREATE PROJECT** to create a new GCP project, or select an existing project.
1. Enable the **Google Drive API** for the project by clicking **ENABLE**.
1. On the sidebar, select **Credentials**.
1. Configure the OAuth 2.0 Consent Screen (the page that asks "Do you want to allow (Your Company) to access Google Drive on your behalf?"). Click **CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN**.
   1. Choose a **User Type** of **External** so the app will be available to customers.
   1. Fill out the OAuth consent screen with an app name (company or product name), support email, app logo, domain, etc.
   1. Domains can be ignored for now.
   1. On the next page, add the scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`.
   1. Enter some **test users** for testing purposes.
      The app will only work for those testing users until it is "verified" by Google.
      When ready for verification (Google verifies privacy policy statement, etc), click **PUBLISH APP** on the **OAuth consent screen**.
      This will allow customers to authorize the integration to access their Google Drive.
1. Once the "Consent Screen" is configured, open the **Credentials** page from the sidebar again.
1. Click **+CREATE CREDENTIALS** and select **OAuth client ID**.
   1. Under **Application type** select **Web application**.
   1. Under **Authorized redirect URIs** enter the OAuth 2.0 callback URL: `https://oauth2.%WHITE_LABEL_BASE_URL%/callback`
   1. Click **CREATE**.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that are generated.

:::info Publishing the OAuth App
Make sure to **publish** the OAuth 2.0 app after testing so users outside of the test users can authorize the integration to interact with Google Drive on their behalf.
:::

#### Configure the Connection

- Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the OAuth app credentials.
- For **Scopes**, use the default [Google Drive scope](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#drive):

  ```
  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
  ```

  - Refer to [Google's OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#drive) for additional scope information.

This connection uses OAuth 2.0, a common authentication mechanism for integrations.
Read about how OAuth 2.0 works [here](../oauth2.md).
